# VBA Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to perform stock performance analysis of 12 different companies across 2017 and 2018. The goal was to utilize VBA in order to produce data showing the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return percentage in order to showcase each company's stock performance side-by-side to decide which stocks would be worth investing in. Beyond analyzing the stocks performance I also examined the significant difference in processing time when utilizing refactored coding for my final stock analysis. 

## Results
### Refactored coding times for 2017 and 2018 are shown below:

The refactored code ran over four times more quickly to produce the information. In 2017 the original code ran in 0.289 seconds and 0.285 for 2018. 

### Refactored code
The code used to produce the results in the stock analysis is shown below. The highlighted code lines are the codes I developed in order to refactor and produce the faster processing code. The various notes within the code are to highlight and address a direct prompt required by the project that guided my coding.

## Summary
Refactoring produced significantly quicker return times on processing VBA code. The refactored coding was also much shorter and easier to read through. Refactored code would be more effective when working in a collaborative environment as the coding was far more cohesive and would be easier for someone else to interpret merely by reading through the code. THe significant drawback to refactoring is the additional time required. Depending on the project timeframe or subsequent billing budget could determine whether refactoring is a feasible or not.
